# Offline version of robert-clifford-zoomable
Offline version has the following modifications:
- leaflet libraries (leaflet.js, leaflet.css, etc.) have been downloaded to the local directory
- tile path is now local -- assumes the the /pays-bas/ directory contains all tiles. The published repo has retained only zoom levels 9-11.

See top-level readme for more general documentation.
